# Description
This program will draw an ellipse around the traffic sign to demonstrate its ability. The traffic signs were also kept elliptical in mind while writing this code, however, in some cases it might also work for triangular, rectangular and hexagonal signs. There is much room for improvement, however, it can greatly help to reduce performance cost in other tasks such as in traffic sign recognition.
